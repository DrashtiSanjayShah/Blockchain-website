1. While trying to make changes in tailwind.config.js, make sure to install npm install @tailwindcss/forms in the client directory to not land onto any errors. (At 1:03:12) 
2. At 1:04:32 particularly MacBook M1 chip users might get an error with the installation. Simply paste this sudo npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers . solved it for me!
